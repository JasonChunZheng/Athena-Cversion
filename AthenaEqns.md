Ideal MHD
---------

In its default configuration, Athena solves the equations of compressible,
adiabatic, inviscid, ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).

where œÅ is the mass density, \\(v\\) the velocity, \\(E\\) the total energy density, \\(B\\) the magnetic field, 
\\(P\\) the gas pressure, and \\(\gamma\\) the adiabatic index (ratio of specific heats).  These equations are written using
units in which the magnetic permeability \\(\mu=1\\). 
Note there is no microscopic dissipation of any kind (viscosity, resistivity, or conduction) 
in the default configuration.

Hydrodynamics
-------------

By configuring the code for hydrodynamics, using

        configure --with-gas=hydro

Athena will solve the Euler equations, i.e. the above system with the fourth (the induction) equation, and all terms that depend on the magnetic field \\(B\\), dropped.

Isothermal Hydrodynamics and MHD
--------------------------------

By configuring the code for an isothermal equation of state, using

        configure --with-eos=isothermal

Athena will solve the above system with the third (the energy) and the last equations dropped, and using a gas pressure \\(P\\) given by an isothermal equation of state \\(P = C^2\rho\\), where \\(C\\) is the isothermal sound speed.

Additional Physics
------------------

Athena includes options for a wide range of additional physics, represented by the following
system of equations:

In the above, \\(C_i\ i=1,...,N\\) are the mass fractions of \\(N\\) passive scalars.  This allows for evolving fluids composed
of multiple species, e.g. neutrals and ions.

\\(\phi\\) and \\(\varphi\\) are the gravitational potentials due to the fluid (self-gravity) and/or a fixed external mass,
respectively.  The former is given by a solution of Poisson's equation.  Stresses due to self-gravity
are added through the gravitational stress tensor \\(G\\).  The static gravitational potential \\(\varphi\\) can be set to any
function of position.

\\(\Pi\\) is the viscous stress tensor, which contains both isotropic and anisotropic components, controlled
by the coefficients \\(\nu_0\\) and \\(\nu_{||}\\) respectively.  In the anisotropic
case, the viscous flux is confined to be parallel to the magnetic field lines.

\\(Q\\) is the heat flux, which contains both isotropic and anisotropic components, controlled by the
coefficients \\(\kappa_0\\) and \\(\kappa_{||}\\) respectively.  In the anisotropic case, the heat flux is
confined to be parallel to the magnetic field lines.

\\(H\\) is a per particle external heating rate, while \\(\Lambda\\) is the per-particle cooling rate due to optically-thin
radiation.  Both can be set to arbitrary functions.

The induction equation includes a variety of non-ideal MHD effects, including Ohmic dissipation (controlled
by the resistivity \\(\eta\\)), the Hall effect (controlled by \\(\eta_H\\)) and ambipolar diffusion (controlled by
\\(\\eta_{AD}\\)).
