Perhaps the most common task for new users of Athena is writing new problem generator functions.

A large number of examples of problem generators can be found in `src/prob` and `athena/apps` directories.

Further instructions on how to write problem generators, and how to use functions in the parser (`athena/src/par.c`) to
read input from the input file can be found in this [User Guide section]({{site.baseurl}}/AthenaDocsUGProbGens)
