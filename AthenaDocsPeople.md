Development of Athena began in 2000, led by J. Stone, T. Gardiner, and P. Teuben at the University of Maryland,
with support from the [NSF](http://www.nsf.gov) Information Technology Research program through grant AST-0113571.
Since then, the list of collaborators contributing to the code has grown substantially, and the institution hosting
the primary development has switched to Princeton.  Continued funding support from both the DOE and NSF are acknowledged.

Below is a list of the major contributors to the code to date:

**Xuening Bai** (Princeton University)
